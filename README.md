# YouTube Video Title Announcer

This Chrome extension announces the title of a YouTube video when it loads.  This is especially useful if you are listening to a playlist that is minimized or in another tab.

I haven't packaged this yet as an actual extension though you can load it yourself.  It also only works on your active tab at the moment, so to use it, you need to have this window open in a separate Chrome window by itself.
